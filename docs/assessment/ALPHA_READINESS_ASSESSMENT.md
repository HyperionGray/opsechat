## Alpha Release Requirements Analysis

### 1. Full Chat Client ✅ COMPLETE

**Requirement:** Chat client must live only in memory, clear memory after use, use e2e encryption with user-provided key, client-side only encryption, randomized usernames, ephemeral hidden service, set disappearing messages time.

#### Current Implementation Status:

✅ **In-Memory Only:** 
- Chat messages stored in `chatlines` list (in-memory only)
- No disk persistence - verified in `runserver.py`
- Messages expire after 180 seconds (3 minutes)

✅ **Memory Clearing:**
- Automatic cleanup via `check_older_than()` function
- Messages removed from list after expiry
- Python garbage collection handles memory cleanup

✅ **E2E Encryption:**
- PGP support implemented via OpenPGP.js
- Client-side encryption/decryption in `static/pgp-manager.js`
- User-provided keys supported
- PGP messages preserved during transmission (no sanitization)

✅ **Client-Side Encryption:**
- All encryption happens in browser via OpenPGP.js
- Private keys stored in browser localStorage only
- No server-side key access

✅ **Randomized Usernames:**
- `id_generator()` creates random session IDs
- Randomized color assignment per user
- No persistent usernames

✅ **Ephemeral Hidden Service:**
- Created via `controller.create_ephemeral_hidden_service()`
- Service destroyed when server stops
- New .onion address each run

✅ **Disappearing Messages:**
- Set to 3 minutes (180 seconds)
- Non-configurable (as specified)
- Automatic cleanup on each request

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**

---

### 2. Burner Email System ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE

**Requirement:** Guerrillamail-style burner email with domain rotation via registrar APIs (at least 2 APIs), spam checking/blocking.

#### Current Implementation Status:

✅ **Burner Email Generation:**
- Implemented in `email_system.py` class `BurnerEmailManager`
- Multi-burner support (multiple active emails per user)

- Missing: Need at least one more registrar API
- Recommendation: Add Namecheap, GoDaddy, or NameSilo API

❌ **Spam Checking/Blocking:**
- No spam filter implemented
- No SpamAssassin or similar integration
- No blacklist checking
- No rate limiting on burner generation

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT** - Need second registrar API and spam filtering

**What's Missing:**
1. Second domain registrar API integration
2. Spam filtering system (SpamAssassin, rspamd, or similar)
3. Email content scanning for spam/abuse
4. Rate limiting on burner generation
5. Burner abuse detection/prevention

---

### 3. Secure Email System ✅ COMPLETE

#### Current Implementation Status:

✅ **HTTPS Service:**
- Flask application ready for HTTPS (via reverse proxy)
- Email routes implemented in `runserver.py`

✅ **E2E Encryption:**
- PGP encryption support
- Client-side encryption via OpenPGP.js

- No disk caching

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**

---

### 4. Zero Disk Touching Policy ✅ COMPLETE

**Requirement:** No plain text should touch disk, no chatroom data on disk, everything in memory, cleared when done, all keys user-defined (except HTTPS keys).

#### Current Implementation Status:

✅ **No Plaintext to Disk:**
- All data structures in-memory only
- `chatlines`, `emails`, `burner_addresses` are Python lists/dicts
- No file writes for user data

✅ **No Chat Data to Disk:**
- Chat messages stored in `chatlines` list
- Cleared every 3 minutes
- No logging of chat content

✅ **Memory-Only Operations:**
- `EmailStorage.emails` - in-memory dict

#### Current Implementation Status:

❌ **No Signup Flow:**
- Current: Direct access to .onion URL
- No user registration
- No account creation
- Only session-based identification

❌ **No Plan Selection:**

- Users must manually navigate to `/email` or `/chats`
- No onboarding flow

✅ **Burner Email No Signup:**
- Burner emails work without any registration
- Session-based only
- Compliant with requirement

**Status:** ❌ **NOT COMPLIANT**

**What's Needed:**
1. User registration/signup page
2. Authentication system (remember: zero disk touching!)
3. Plan selection interface (free tier to start)
4. Product dashboard showing:
   - Chat access
   - Email access
   - Burner email access
5. User onboarding flow

**Design Considerations:**
- Authentication must be ephemeral or session-based
- No persistent user database (conflicts with zero-disk policy)
- OR: User accounts stored encrypted in memory only
- OR: Use client-side authentication (like session keys)

---

### 6. User Education and Key Management ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

## Security and Abuse Prevention

### Current Security Measures ✅

1. **Tor Network Encryption** - All traffic via Tor
2. **Ephemeral Hidden Services** - New .onion each run
3. **PGP Encryption** - Client-side E2E encryption
4. **Input Sanitization** - Regex-based chat filtering
5. **No Persistent Storage** - Everything in memory
6. **Session Isolation** - Random user IDs
7. **XSS Protection** - jQuery 3.7.1, input sanitization
8. **Container Isolation** - Docker/Podman deployment

### Missing Abuse Prevention ❌

1. **No Rate Limiting** - Burner email generation unlimited
2. **No Spam Filtering** - Email content not scanned
3. **No Content Filtering** - No prohibited keyword detection
4. **No Abuse Reporting** - No mechanism for users to report abuse
5. **No Logging for Investigations** - Cannot cooperate with LE (contradiction!)
6. **No IP Logging** - Cannot track abusers (by design, but conflict with requirement)

### Design Conflict: Privacy vs Cooperation 🔴

**The requirement states:**
> "Anyone found to be using this service for nefarious purposes will feel the full wrath of Hyperion Gray, and we absolutely will cooperate with law enforcement."

**Current design prevents this:**
- No user identification (random session IDs)
- No IP logging (Tor anonymity)
- No persistent storage
- No audit trails
- Ephemeral services (destroyed on restart)

**Resolution Needed:**
The requirements contain a fundamental conflict:
- **Privacy requirement:** Zero disk touching, ephemeral, anonymous
- **Abuse prevention requirement:** Cooperate with law enforcement

**Recommendations:**
1. **Option A: Limited Logging**
   - Log only metadata (timestamps, session IDs, .onion address)
   - Encrypted logs, stored separately
   - Auto-delete after 30 days
   - Only accessed with warrant

2. **Option B: Policy as Deterrent**
   - Strong policy language
   - No actual enforcement capability
   - Rely on "chilling effect" of warning
   - Accept that true abuse prevention is impossible with current design

3. **Option C: Hybrid Approach**
   - Normal operations: zero logging
   - If abuse detected: enable temporary logging for that session
   - Require manual intervention to activate
   - Clear disclosure to users

**Recommendation:** Discuss with legal counsel and make explicit decision.

4. Missing legal policies (AUP/ToS)

**Biggest Strengths:**
1. Solid technical architecture
2. True privacy-preserving design
3. Working E2E encryption
4. Complete containerization
5. Good test coverage

**Next Steps:**
1. Make decision on privacy vs cooperation tradeoff
2. Implement user signup flow
